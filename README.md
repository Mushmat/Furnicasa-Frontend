Welcome to the **Furnicasa** front-end repository—the React/Vite codebase that powers a blazing-fast, PWA-ready furniture e-commerce site.  
This project was built end-to-end during my SDE internship, covering **UI, state management, routing, payments, and production deployment**. Feel free to explore the code; every line is meant to be educational and production-grade.
